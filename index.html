  <h4>Note-Fy</h4>
  Note-Fy is an iOS app that uses an on-device Machine Learning model to detect currency notes of different denominations. The model was trained by collecting over a 1000 datapoints (photos of currency notes in different conditions). Image augmentation techniques such as random crop, random exposure, and random rotation were used to increase the size of the dataset. The app was built on Xcode using the Swift programming language. I employed the MVVM design pattern to seggregate the responsibilities in the app codebase.<br>

<h4>This Website</h4>
This website was made using pure HTML and CSS. The design was inspired by GitHub's markdown CSS. The website uses media queries to support dark and light modes with different colour themes. It uses media queries to also adjust for various screen sizes and be responsive. The website is packaged and deployed to be hosted on surge.sh, a CLI tool to host static websites.
